Elasticsearch will analyze the Text before it’s stored into the Inverted Index 
while it won’t analyze Keyword type. 

Analyzed or not analyzed will affect how it will behave when getting queried.

the difference between Match Query and Term Query is that the query in 
Match Query will get analyzed into terms first, while the query in Term Query 
will not.
